## üí° How to Interpret Results

### Color-Coded Signal Plot
Look at the background colors to instantly identify:
- Which frequency bands dominate different time periods
- Where frequency transitions occur (changepoints)
- Stability of frequency content (few changes = stable, many = variable)

### Frequency Band Timeline  
Use this to see the "frequency story" of your signal:
- Each horizontal bar represents a time segment
- Bar position shows which band (Œ¥, Œ∏, Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥)
- Bar length shows duration
- Vertical red lines = frequency transitions

### Top Components Table
Understand the most important frequencies in your signal:
- **Rank #1** = most prevalent frequency
- **Duration** = total time this frequency appears
- **% of Signal** = how dominant this frequency is
- **Occurrences** = how many separate segments

### Individual Component Plots
Deep-dive into each important frequency:
- See how magnitude varies over time
- Identify when this frequency is strong vs. weak
- Correlate with changepoints
- Understand frequency-specific dynamics

## üéØ Use Cases

### Example 1: EEG Signal Analysis
**Top Components:**
1. 10.5 Hz (alpha) - 65% of signal - Awake, relaxed state
2. 5.2 Hz (theta) - 20% of signal - Drowsiness periods
3. 15.8 Hz (beta) - 10% of signal - Active concentration
4. 2.1 Hz (delta) - 5% of signal - Deep relaxation

**Interpretation:** Subject was mostly in relaxed alpha state with brief theta (drowsy) and beta (active) periods.

### Example 2: Oscillatory System
**Top Components:**
1. 50.0 Hz (gamma) - 80% of signal - Primary oscillation
2. 100.0 Hz (gamma) - 15% of signal - Second harmonic
3. 150.0 Hz (gamma) - 5% of signal - Third harmonic

**Interpretation:** System oscillates at 50 Hz with harmonic components.

### Example 3: Variable Frequency Signal
**Top Components:**
1. 12.3 Hz (alpha) - 30% - Segment 1-3
2. 8.7 Hz (alpha) - 25% - Segment 4-6
3. 15.2 Hz (beta) - 20% - Segment 7-9
4. 6.1 Hz (theta) - 15% - Segment 10-12
5. 20.5 Hz (beta) - 10% - Segment 13-15

**Interpretation:** Highly variable signal with multiple frequency regimes.

## üîß Technical Details

### Frequency Component Extraction
```python
# For each segment between changepoints:
1. Extract instantaneous frequency from spectrogram
2. Compute median frequency for the segment
3. Round to nearest 0.5 Hz for grouping
4. Track duration and occurrences
5. Rank by total duration
6. Select top 5

# For each top component:
1. Find closest frequency bin in spectrogram
2. Extract magnitude array over time
3. Create filled area plot
4. Add changepoint markers
5. Classify into frequency band
```

### Color Scheme
Bands use perceptually distinct colors:
- **Delta:** Brown (low frequency, earthy)
- **Theta:** Dark orange (transitional)
- **Alpha:** Gold (prominent, important)
- **Beta:** Deep sky blue (higher frequency, cool)
- **Gamma:** Blue violet (highest frequency, energetic)

### Interactive Features
All plots are **fully interactive** with Plotly:
- ‚úÖ Zoom, pan, reset
- ‚úÖ Hover for exact values
- ‚úÖ Click legend to hide/show traces
- ‚úÖ Save as PNG
